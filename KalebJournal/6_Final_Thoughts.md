Final Thoughts
    This has been a really fun project. I really appreciate that the project feels like a real developer experience. It was very fun to come up with our own idea and have the freedom to implement it however we saw fit. I enjoyed working with my partner George, we worked efficiently together. I do wish we had a little more time for more and better features, but I am pretty happy with all of the work that we got done.

    Thank you again!
