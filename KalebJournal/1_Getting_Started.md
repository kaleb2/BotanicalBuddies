Setting up the Repository:
    George and I really wanted to build this project one full stack feature at a time. That way we would both get experience at each level of the application. To get started though we needed to build the stack itself together before we could add features to it individually. For the first two meetings we pair programmed working together to build out a backend with Express, and a frontend using React.

    We started with the express-generator to get our backend project going. This tool added a lot more to the project than we were expecting though which did confuse us for a minute. Luckily, we had Doggr to look at and see what we needed and what we could cut. Doggr was a great example for us and helped us get through a couple more issues that typically came down to installing typescript correctly.

    For the second round of pair programming, we used the create react app tool to start on the frontend. This was just as easy as it was in class. We were able to get it connected to the backend with ease. Once we got it sending a request to the backend on a button click, we decided it was in a good enough state to be able to begin individual tasks.

Logistics:
    With our repository set up in GitHub with a full stack, we were ready to start planning some development. I created a Trello board just so we could make a list of objectives and track when they are done. I felt this was important just to keep our plans organized, not as an accountability tool. We also found that Tuesdays and Thursdays would be good times for us to have regular check ins. Though, we both are available via text if something was more urgent. 

First Feature Set
    For our first feature set we wanted to get BotanicalBuddies on pace with Doggr, which meant having Users in the backend, persistence in a postgres data base, and a front end for creating users with authentication. That unfortunately sounded like one big feature, not the smaller features we thought we could implement individually. Instead, we agreed to go with our roles that we put on paper. George is the lead on frontend and authentication, so he would add user creation and authentication to the frontend. I am the lead on backend and database persistence, so I would add the user routes to the backend and build our docker container to store them. With that we were on our way.
